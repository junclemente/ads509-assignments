Looking at the statistical data for lyrics, Cher has a lower lexical diversity compared to Robyn, but Cher also has twice as many words (tokens) in the dataset compared to Robyn which would lead to a lower lexical diversity. The Twitter data are tweets from their fan base and have about an equal amount of tokens making for a better comparison. Robyn has a higher lexical diversity compared to Cher for tweets showing that Europeans might have a better grasp of utilizing all aspects of the English language. On the other hand, the higher lexical diversity for Robyn could also represent the diversity of English language used from different countries.\n"
