"Strings (Dance Version)"

So delicate (Teka 'wag muna baka mabasag)

These feelings for you (Hey!)

'Wag munang magulo (Nag-uumpisa pa lamang)

Nakikinig ba kayo?

You know you got to listen



Sinabi na dating ginusto ko 'to

Pero bakit nangyari lahat ng ito?

Nagmamadali, nagkakandarapa

Kita mong pabagsak na sa lupa

Pwede ba muna tayo pumara?

Parang 'di ko na ito kaya



Scared to admit but I'm broken

In need to fix this fire

Balancing on this tight rope

About to fall from the sky (Yah, yah, yah, yah)



I'm on strings, don't cut me off (Yah, yah, yah)

No wings, don't let me fall off this now (Yah, yah, yah)

I'm on strings, just hanging on

Gotta, gotta wake up, wake up, get higher (Yah, yah, yah)



I'm really, really trying, but sometimes

I ain't strong inside, can't lie



Minsan kailangan ko ring aminin

'Pag nahihirapan, dapat sabihin

Kaya tara, tara zoom, binibini, bloom

Pero, pero take a break

Baby, if you feel doomed

So love yourself first, before this all hurts

Untie all the knots, believe and you'll make it

Sana naman marinig mo ito

Nahihirapan, naghihingalo

Alam kong kaya pero

Pwede ba munang huminto dito?

Aiah, ready, set, position

Stacey, fighting on our own

Maloi, hinding-hindi susuko

Jhoanna, taas noo, titingala

(Gwen, nobody can't stop me)

Colet, this race I can ace

Sheena, no pressure, I'm steady

Mikha, got nothing against me



Tara, tara zoom, binibini, bloom

Pero, pero take a break

Baby, if you feel doomed

So love yourself first, before this all hurts

Untie all the knots, believe and you'll make it
