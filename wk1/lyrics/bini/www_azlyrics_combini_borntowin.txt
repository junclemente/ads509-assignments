"Born To Win"

Yeah, I felt it, and I've been there through different phases

I've been feeling like I don't have the power in me

It took me a few dead-ends to finally understand

Got to push harder, the failures only made me strong



I used to be so careless, careless

But now I'm more than fearless, fearless

Don't stop yourself 'cause the world is ours

We're made to be broken

But we won't stop, we won't stop

So let me hear it, I'm on it



Now every step we take, boundary we break

There's nothing we can't do, do, do

When it gets hard to see, just repeat after me

There's nothing you can't do, do, do

Nothing can hold us back

Let's make the moment last

What you have within won't fade away

'Cause baby, we were born to win



Listen up, do this, do that

Just climb up the ladder and give a helping hand

Sometimes it's harder, then all you need is some time

It'll take you a few dead-ends to finally understand

Got to push harder, the failures only make you strong



I used to be so careless, careless

But now I'm more than fearless, fearless

Don't stop yourself 'cause the world is ours

We're made to be broken

But we won't stop, we won't stop

So let me hear it, I'm on it



Now every step we take, boundary we break

There's nothing we can't do, do, do

When it gets hard to see, just repeat after me

There's nothing you can't do, do, do

Nothing can hold us back

Let's make the moment last

What you have within won't fade away

'Cause baby, we were born to win



Now, I have found my confidence, confidence

There's only one me, yeah

We were born to live

Born to make mistakes

Every boundary we break

Every step we take

Together we can go facing anything

(Listen, baby)



Now every step we take, boundary we break

There's nothing we can't do, do, do

When it gets hard to see, just repeat after me

There's nothing you can't do, do, do

Nothing can hold us back

Let's make the moment last

What you have within won't fade away

'Cause baby, we were born to win

We were born to win
