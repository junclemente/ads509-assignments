"TOP"

T-O-P, top, I'll take you to the top

T-O-P, top, I'll take you to the top (Oh)



Ey, what's up? Time is slippin' away (Oh, oh)

'Di mapakali, parang ang haba ng day

When we're together, lumilinaw ang kulay (Oh, oh)

Ang saya-saya ng bonding 'pag ang friends mo ay tunay



Feels like I'm living the dream

It's time to let go, oh

One, two, three, let's go!



Buckle up (Hey), I'll take you to the top (Ooh)

Tara na, abutin ang lahat ng pangarap mo

Round and round (Hey), I'll take you to the top (Ooh)



Basta't kasama kayo, tayo hanggang dulo



T-O-P, top, I'll take you to the top

T-O-P, top, I'll take you to the top



Tara na, let's go

'Lika na, sama-sama tayong tatakbo

Got your back, mapa-rain or shine

Huwag ka nang mag-alala, we'll be just fine

Sabay-sabay, walang mauuna (Ey)

It's the weekend, mag-ice cream ka na muna

What's up 'til makarating tayo (Hey, hey, hey)

Tip to top, tayo hanggang dulo



Feels like I'm living the dream

It's time to let go, oh

One, two, three, let's go!



Buckle up (Hey), I'll take you to the top (Ooh)

Tara na, abutin ang lahat ng pangarap mo

Round and round (Hey), I'll take you to the top (Ooh)

Basta't kasama kayo, tayo hanggang dulo



T-O-P, top (Hey), I'll take you to the top

T-O-P, top (Hey), I'll take you to the top (Let's take it to the top)

T-O-P, top, I'll take you to the top

T-O-P, top, I'll take you to the top (Yeah, yeah)



Buckle up, I'll take you to the top (Take you to the top)

Tara na, abutin ang lahat ng pangarap mo (Just let go, bitaw na, huminga ka muna)

Round and round (Hey), I'll take you to the top (Ooh)

Basta't kasama kayo, tayo hanggang dulo



T-O-P, top (Hey), I'll take you to the top

T-O-P, top (Hey), I'll take you to the top (I'll take you to the top)

T-O-P, top (Hey), I'll take you to the top

T-O-P, top (Hey), I'll take you to the top



T-O-P, top, let's take it to the top

T-O-P, top, let's take it to the top (So much love on top)
