"Made For All"

It's B-I-N-I

BINI with Maybelline

Are you ready for this?

Here we go



Feelin' like you ain't got it

Like you don't belong, can't seem to fit in

Wanna hide, keep overthinkin'

Gotta have that confidence, girl

Get up and show the world

Mag-lipstick, kilay, fonda't mascara

Maaga man, handa nang rumampa



Open your eyes

Believe that you can shine bright, oh



Made for you, made for me

Handa ka ba sa beauty reveal? (Made for all)

Made for you, made for me

Face the world, express how you feel



Made for every color, race, shape, height, weight

No limit to your gender, race and age

Every shade and hue, have the courage to be you

No space for hate, it's time to celebrate (ayy)

Maybe, you're born with it (ayy)

Maybe, it's Maybelline (yeah)

Moreno o mestiza, pinay beauty o chinita

Lahat tayo, may sariling ganda



Open your eyes

Let 'em sparkle, shine bright

Ipagmalaki mo sa buong mundo

Ang ganda na iyong iyo, oh-oh-oh



Made for you, made for me

Handa ka ba sa beauty reveal? (Made for all)

Made for you, made for me

Face the world, express how you feel



'Wag magtago, ipagmalaki mo

Ang ganda na iyong iyo (made for all)

'Wag papatalo, beauty, i-flaunt mo

Bawat araw ay 'yong iyo (made for me)

Made for you, made for all

Made for all
