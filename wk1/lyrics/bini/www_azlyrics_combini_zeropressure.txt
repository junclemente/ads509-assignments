"Zero Pressure"

Heaven knows a force of nature

I come in like a hurricane

I'll take you down without a chaser

Till everybody knows my name



It ain't about the fame

I wanna be remembered for the way the world gon' change, yes



I got fire in my blood when I move

No, you won't catch me holding out for a miracle

I'm right here and I got nothing to lose

Baby, I'm always looking up at the pinnacle

Never hold back, no

Give a little extra, always doin' better

Keeping the heat on

Zero pressure, zero diamonds



Ain't no one gonna give it to ya

Gotta grab before it goes

Even if it falls to ruins (Woah)

I'll never give in to the pain



It ain't about the fame

I wanna be remembered for the way the world gon' change, yes



I got fire in my blood when I move

No, you won't catch me holding out for a miracle

I'm right here and I got nothing to lose

Baby, I'm always looking up at the pinnacle

Never hold back, no

Give a little extra, always doin' better

Keeping the heat on

Zero pressure, zero diamonds



(Ooh, ooh) Zero pressure

(Ooh, ooh) Zero diamonds

(Ooh, ooh) Zero pressure, zero diamonds

(Ooh, ooh) Zero pressure

(Ooh, ooh) You'll get zero diamonds

(Ooh, ooh) Zero pressure, zero diamonds



Ooh, yeah



I got fire in my blood when I move (Fire in my blood when I move)

No, you won't catch me holding out for a miracle (Miracle)

I'm right here and I got nothing to lose (I got, I got, I got)

Baby, I'm always looking up at the pinnacle (Oh)

Never hold back, no (Ooh)

Give a little extra, always doin' better

Keeping the heat on

Zero pressure, zero diamonds



(Ooh, ooh) Zero pressure

(Ooh, ooh) Zero diamonds

(Ooh, ooh) Zero pressure, zero diamonds

(Ooh, ooh) Zero pressure

(Ooh, ooh)You'll get zero diamonds

(Ooh, ooh) Zero pressure, zero diamonds
