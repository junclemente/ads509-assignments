"ICON"

Penshoppe



I-i-icon

Oh baby babe

Go roll the carpet out tonight

Ay, ay

We'll make em wait

The girls are coming out in style

Ay, ay

Honey, there's no limits

Be who you wanna be

Ay, ay

Every night's our moment now

Imma be me

Ay, ay



Hmmm when you walk in

All the world is in your hands

And oh you can own it

Baby it's your time

Know that it's your time



Go leave 'em wanting to know

Wanting to know your name

I-i-icon

Don't let 'em forget

Go on and leave 'em wanting to go

Wanting to go your way

I-i-icon

Oh they won't regret

'Cause you're gonna be your own icon

I-i-icon, i-i-icon

You know you could be your own icon

I-i-icon

Oh they won't forget

That you're an icon



Listen up now

Be you 'cause there ain't none better

See you on the front page cover

Make 'em talk about you like a storyteller

Let 'em take a pic, it'll last you longer

I see you rocking it, own it

Oh BINI knocking it out of the park

Keep wearing your style like you a star



Hmmm when you walk in

All the world is in your hands

And oh you can own it

Baby it's your time

Know that it's your time



Go leave 'em wanting to know

Wanting to know your name

I-i-icon

Don't let 'em forget

Go on and leave 'em wanting to go

Wanting to go your way

I-i-icon

Oh they won't regret

'Cause you're gonna be your own icon

I-i-icon, i-i-icon

You know you could be your own icon

I-i-icon

Oh they won't forget

That you're an icon



Oh believe me, you can be whatever you want

O BINI BINI trust that you're an icon

Believe me, you is all that you'd ever want

To be 'cause you can own it, you're an icon



Hmmm when you walk in

All the world is in your hands

And oh you can own it

Baby it's your time

Know that it's your time



Go leave 'em wanting to know

Wanting to know your name

I-i-icon

Don't let 'em forget

Go on and leave 'em wanting to go

Wanting to go your way

I-i-icon

Oh they won't regret

'Cause you're gonna be your own icon

I-i-icon, i-i-icon

You know you could be your own icon

I-i-icon

Oh they won't forget

That you're an icon
