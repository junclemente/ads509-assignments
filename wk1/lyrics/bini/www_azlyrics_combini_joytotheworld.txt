Pasko na naman sa Pinas

Setyembre pa lang nagsisimula

Apat na buwan na kasiyahan

Walang sawang pagdiriwang

Puto bumbong at bibingka

Fruit cake na pinasa pasa

Lechon, hamon, queso de bola

Handa para sa Noche Buena

Simbang gabi at Christmas party

Caroling gabi gabi

Barkada ay panay ang aya

Basta kasama rin buong pamilya



One, two, three, go



He rules the world with truth and grace

And makes (And makes) the nations (The nations) prove

The glories of his righteousness

And wonders of His love

And wonders of His love

And wonders, wonders of His love

And wonders, wonders of His love



Joy to the world

Wonders of his love

Joy to the world

Joy to the world
