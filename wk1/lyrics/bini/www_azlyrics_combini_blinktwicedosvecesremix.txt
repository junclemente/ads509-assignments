"Blink Twice (Dos Veces Remix)"

I heard you like confidence

Well, I've got a lot of it

So, baby, use common sense

Just don't be anonymous



I heard that you've been busy, yeah, I heard it through the grapevine

Trying my best not to step up on your landmine

Let's have some fun with it

'Cause you know I'm running it



Ooh-ooh, I'm lost inside your world, you got that symphony

Like da-du, da-du, da-du



If you like me, blink twice

Are you naughty or nice?

Maybe add a little spice

If you're tryna roll the dice (dice)

Let me give you some advice

If you like me, blink twice, uh-huh



Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

He's not even thinking 'bout me

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

Maybe he's just looking at me



TÃº me estÃ¡s pensando

O solo mirando

Pero me guiÃ±Ã³ el ojito

Y me estÃ¡ gustando

Me voy pegando con un par de tequilas

Yo no soy fÃ¡cil, baby, ponte las pilas



Eeny, meeny, miney, mo

TÃº sabes cÃ³mo es el flow

Con otra va rÃ¡pido

Conmigo va, pero slow, oh

Arriba, abajo, al centro y pa' dentro



Si te gusta mi size

Es porque me veo nice

'Toy caliente, spice

Un traguito con ice

Yo soy tu baby spice

Â¿QuÃ© vamo' a hacer tonight? Uh-huh



Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

No sÃ© si tÃº estÃ¡s pensando en mÃ­

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

O solo me estÃ¡s mirando



If you, you really like me

Baby, then just blink twice

If you, you really like me

Then you gotta roll the dice



If you like me, blink twice

Are you naughty or nice?

Maybe add a little spice

If you're tryna roll the dice

Let me give you some advice

If you like me, blink twice, uh-huh



Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

He's not even thinking 'bout me

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

Maybe he's just looking at me



Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

He's not even thinking 'bout me

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

Maybe he's just looking at me



Maybe he's just looking at me
