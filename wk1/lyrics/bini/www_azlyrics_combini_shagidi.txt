"Shagidi"

Ah, hahaha

Ay, laro na lang

Okay, oh, tara, tara

Do you guys know shagidi, shagidi, sha-po-po? (Ano 'yon? What's that?)



You might be slick but

You ain't slicker than me

You might be four, three, two

But I'm one, two, three



Rotate that body

Then touch your feet

Oh, my gosh

Like O-M-G



Shagidi, shagidi, sha-po-po

Shagidi, shagidi, sha-po-po

Shagidi, shagidi, sha-po-po (Hah, hah, hah, hah)

Shagidi, shagidi, sha-po-po

Shagidi, shagidi, sha-po-po

Shagidi, shagidi, sha-po-po (Hah, hah, hah, hah)



Do my, now do my dance

Do my, now do my dance

Do my, now do my dance

I bet you can't do my dance

Do your, now do your dance

Do your, now do your dance

Do your, now do your dance

I bet they can't do your dance



Pusta ako sa'yo na 'di mo kaya 'to

Sisimplehan ko pa para makagaya ka

Basta 'pag sinimulan ay susundan na

But I bet you can't dance like this

Watch me snap, now watch me jig

You can't do it like I did

Pop, foot rock, then I drop real quick

Go 'head to the right then left with it



Rotate that body

Go put in work

Oh, my gosh

Who gon' time first?



Shagidi, shagidi, sha-po-po

Shagidi, shagidi, sha-po-po

Shagidi, shagidi, sha-po-po (Hah, hah, hah, hah)

Shagidi, shagidi, sha-po-po

Shagidi, shagidi, sha-po-po

Shagidi, shagidi, sha-po-po (Hah, hah, hah, hah)



Do my, now do my dance

Do my, now do my dance

Do my, now do my dance

I bet you can't do my dance

Do your, now do your dance

Do your, now do your dance

Do your, now do your dance

I bet they can't do your dance



I stomp, she stomp, then clap

She stomp, then clap, then jump

I bet you can't keep up (Nah, I bet you can't keep up)

I rock, she rock and snap

She rock and snap, then lean

I bet you won't beat me (Nah, I bet you won't beat me)

Watch me



Shagidi, shagidi, sha-po-po

Shagidi, shagidi, sha-po-po

Shagidi, shagidi, sha-po-po (Hah, hah, hah, hah)



Do my, now do my dance

Do my, now do my dance

Do my, now do my dance
