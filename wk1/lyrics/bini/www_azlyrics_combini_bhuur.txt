"B HU U R"

Be who you are (Be who you are)

Shine like the stars (Shine like the stars)

Let's celebrate 'cause it's a new day

Let the sunlight come shining into your life



We can make it, if we give love

Spread the good vibes

Make someone happy today



The world is opening-up

It's time for a ride

Let's rise to the top

Forget, leave your worries behind

Let's talk and have fun

Be together as one



Be who you are (Be who you are)

Shine like the stars (Shine like the stars)

We'll be here with you

Let's make the whole world happy

Be who you are (Be who you are)

Shine like the stars (Shine like the stars)

We'll be here with you

We're gonna make this world dance



We're gonna make this world dance

We're gonna make this world dance

Kaway-kaway (Kaway-kaway)

Sabay-sabay (Sabay-sabay)

Hello and hi

Ola, hey, mabuhay

We're gonna make this world dance

Ola, hey, mabuhay

Kaway-kaway (Kaway-kaway)

Sabay-sabay (Sabay-sabay)

Hello and hi

Ola, hey, mabuhay



Huminga lang ng malalim at huwag ka papatalo

Isagad mo ang pangarap, hindi 'yan limitado

Huminga lang ng malalim at huwag ka papatalo

Share the vibe, share the love

Ilabas mo ang 'yong kwento

It's a wonderful day

Be glad for everyday

'Di ka nag-iisa, tayo'y magsama-sama

Napintas nga aldaw kin-yayo amin

Shagit everybody kun nakasabot ka hin

Taga-siin ka hay? Kosa ditto nombre?

Ka-sayata-mo nehh, everybody say



The world is opening-up

It's time for a ride

Let's rise to the top

(To the top, to the top, to the top)

Forget, leave your worries behind

Let's talk and have fun

Be together as one



Be who you are (Be who you are)

Shine like the stars (Shine like the stars)

We'll be here with you

Let's make the whole world happy

Be who you are (Be who you are)

Shine like the stars (Shine like the stars)

We'll be here with you

We're gonna make this world dance



Halika, sumama ka sa amin

Kalimutan ang lahat ng pangit na pangitain

Alisin ang negatibo at mga suliranin

(We're gonna make this world dance)

Tanggalin ang pighati, ngiti ang dapat unahin

Sabay ng pagsikat ng araw, may bagong umaga

Na maghahatid ng panibagong saya at pag-asa

Kapag tayo'y sama-sama, abot langit ang ligaya

Lakasan mo pa ang tawa, kalimutan ang problema

Basta importante wala kang tatapakan na iba (Be who you are)

Hala sige, patuloy umabante (Be who you are)

Enjoyin mo lang lahat ng dadaanang byahe

Kasama mo ako magbahagi ng kaligayahan sa buong mundo (Be who you are)

Lahat ay mapapa-sa'yo (Be who you are)

Basta palagi ka lamang na dapat magpapakatotoo



Be-be-be-be, be you

Be-be-be-be, be real

Be-be-be-be, be you

Basta palagi ka lamang na dapat magpapakatotoo

(Be who you are)

Be-be-be-be, be you

Be-be-be-be, be real

Be-be-be-be, be you (Shine like a star)

Kaway-kaway

Sabay-sabay (I'll be here with you)

Hello and hi

Ola, hey, mabuhay (We're gonna be here for you)

Ola, hey, mabuhay

Ola, hey, mabuhay

Ola, hey, mabuhay

(Ola, hey, mabuhay)

(Ola, hey, mabuhay)
