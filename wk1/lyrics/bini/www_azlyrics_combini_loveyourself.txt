"Love Yourself"

Attention, c'mon, look at me

These are things you gotta see



Hey, leave the numbers and measures

Love your shape, it's precious

Baby, I believe, never can beat

Us if we just be, what we gotta be, you'll see



Oh no, don't you ever question that

Your worth is so much more and that's a fact

'Wag papatalo sa sinasabi ng iba

Humingang malalim, buong-loob sabihin



Tara na't ika'y makiisa

Tignan mo, ang ganda mo kaya

Buksan lang ang mga mata

Lo-lo-lo-love yourself

Basta't tibayan ang loob

Hindi ka mapapataob, 'lika na

Just lo-lo-love yourself



C'mon, shake your body, confidently

And feel it move effortlessly

Be free to see the beauty of your body

Two, three, shout it out, say it with me



Stop comparin', we celebratin'

The life we have with pride and honor, yeah we precious

More precious than the jewels you could ever find

You shine brighter, my love (Ang ganda, ganda mo)

Tall, short, thin, thicc, light, dark hair

Skin type, color, race, hey, we don't care (Ang ganda, ganda mo)

Can't be labeled, can't be boxed, we don't belong there

Gotta be empowered know we got flare



Oh no, don't you ever question that

Your worth is so much more and that's a fact

'Wag papatalo sa sinasabi ng iba

Humingang malalim, buong-loob sabihin



Tara na't ika'y makiisa

Tignan mo, ang ganda mo kaya

Buksan lang ang mga mata

Lo-lo-lo-love yourself

Basta't tibayan ang loob

Hindi ka mapapataob, 'lika na

Just lo-lo-love yourself



Ohh-oh-oh, hindi ka nag-iisa

'Pag nangangamba

'Wag kang mag-alala

Ikaw ay mahalaga



Love yourself

Love yourself

Let's go



Tara na't ika'y makiisa

Tignan mo, ang ganda mo kaya

Buksan lang ang mga mata

Lo-lo-lo-love yourself

Basta't tibayan ang loob

Hindi ka mapapataob, 'lika na

Just lo-lo-love yourself



Let me hear you say, B-I-N-I

Love my body and myself

I am worthy, I am free

Don't care what you say, just wanna be me

Gain all the confidence then lose

Only what weighs you down

All they got are standards but we got no limits

Respect, embrace, accept and love

BINI! (Real magic)

Just lo-lo-love yourself
