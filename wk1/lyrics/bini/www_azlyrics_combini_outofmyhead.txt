"Out Of My Head"

Let's go



Stepped out of a movie scene

Feels like you are my wildest dreams

I'll be the queen and you'll be the knight

But don't you think I won't speak my mind

Coming out of a fantasy

Make believe in our greatest schemes

I'll cast a spell and you'll do the crime

A match more perfect than fate designed



Tick-tock, the clock is talking

Don't think too much (Don't think too much)

It's just a simple question

To fall, to fall, (Hey) to fall in love



I want out of my, I want out of my head

Can't seem to find, can't seem to find the path ahead

You're makin' me blind (Hey)

And keepin' me up at night (Hey)

Don't know which way to go (Hey)

My heart's lost all control (Hey)

I want out of my, I want out of my head

(Out of my head)



Come on, come on, hey, don't walk away

Sometimes what's scary is worth all the pain

Pressure from stone, build it like diamonds

I'll be the queen of all our islands (Yeah)

Be real, be true, be calm

Babe, love can do no wrong

Don't overthink, don't stand on the edge

Life is much sweeter when you're off the ledge (Oh)

Hey, wanna take time, wanna figure things out

Treat me like the one, show me all the good crowds

Need a rose or a story to tell

Might be known as the candy that fell (Oh)

My mind, my heart, ain't trusted

Been at war since you just walked in

'Scuse me for bein' straightforward

You make me wanna lose then start all over



Tick tock, the clock is talking

Don't think too much (Don't think too much)

It's just a simple question

To fall, to fall (Hey) to fall in love



I want out of my, I want out of my head

Can't seem to find, can't seem to find the path ahead

You're makin' me blind (Hey)

And keepin' me up at night (Hey)

Don't know which way to go (Hey)

My heart's lost all control (My heart's lost all control)

I want out of my, I want out of my head

(Out of my head)



Can't help how you race through my mind (Race through my mind)

And fill my dreams with the sweetest desires (Sweetest desires)

Didn't think I'd fall in love this way

It's crazy how you make me say



I want out of my, I want out of my head (Hey)

Can't seem to find, can't seem to find the path ahead (Oh)

I want out of my, I want out of my head (Hey)

Can't seem to find, can't seem to find the path ahead (Out of my head)

You're makin' me blind (Makin' me blind)

And keepin' me up at night (Keepin' me up at night)

Don't know which way to go

My heart's lost all control (Losing control)

I want out of my, I want out of my head

(Out of my head)
