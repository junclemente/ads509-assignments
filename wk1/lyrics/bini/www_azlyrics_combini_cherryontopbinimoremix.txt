"Cherry On Top (BiniMo Remix)"

My presence is a present (Ooh, ooh-yeah-yeah)

Talkin' French, I'll keep you guessin' (Ooh, ooh-lÃ -lÃ )

Know you got a little candy crush (Crush)

Be careful 'cause you'll never get enough (Enough)



Every day

Celebrate you're with me

Every day

It's your birthday on repeat, birthday on repeat-eat, yeah



If you want it sweet, got that sugar on lock

If you want that spice, I can turn the heat up

Baby, I'm the cake, better know what you got

I'm the cherry on top, cherry on top

Honey, you're a bee, got you buzzin' 'round me

Sticky, sticky, sweet, frosty as I can be

Baby, I'm the cake, better know what you got

I'm the cherry on top, cherry on top



She do it well (She ate)

No crumbs on (Her plate)

Every time I come around

Boys wanna celebrate, yeah

I got you makin' a wish

Ribbons are most of my gifts

Dreamin' of my cherry lips

Yummy, yummy, yum



Ooh, I got a little somethin' for you

Ooh, I got what you like

Ooh, I got a little somethin' for you

My, my, oh, my, my



Cherry, cherry, I'm so berry, rainbow, cotton candy

Glitzy glamour, drippin' drama, oh, I'm just so fancy (Ooh)

You can't deny, no-no, you can't deny (Uh, uh)

I'm the cherry on top, cherry on top



Nakuha ka sa'king tingin

Kala mo 'di ko mapapansin

Nakaabang bawat galaw

Magsasayaw, magsasayaw

Sumabay ka sa indak (Indak)

Mata'y kumikislap (Kislap)

Lahat malinaw na (Yeah)

Hindi ako tulad ng iba

It's your birthday on repeat, birthday on repeat-eat, yeah

Sticky, sticky, sweet, frosty as I can be (Uh-huh)
