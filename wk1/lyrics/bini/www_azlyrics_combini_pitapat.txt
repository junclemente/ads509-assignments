"Pit A Pat"

Pit-a-pat, my heart is saying

There's a fire, you can't contain it

I don't need a boy to save me

Na-na-na-na-na-na



See you watching me from across the room

It's so obvious, I got you nervo-o-ous

See you wondering how to get my attention

Yeah, I'm flattered but it doesn't matter



I might be young, but I know, I know what I want

And it's not love, I'm not, I'm not in a rush

Yeah, I might laugh along, but I'm just being polite

Don't go thinking I'm yours, you're the last thing on my mind



Busy tryna give it my everything 'cause life's not Disney

I don't need a knight in shining armor

So you gotta respect that I got that X factor

Oh, I'm gonna make it rain, yeah, uh, uh, let's go



Pit-a-pat, my heart is saying

There's a fire, you can't contain it

I don't need a boy to save me

Na-na-na-na-na-na

Pit-a-pat, my heart is saying

It's my dream, I gotta chase it

I don't see that ever changing

Na-na-na-na-na-na



Make it happen on my own, gonna be a lonely road

But I gotta buckle up, buckle up for the Grand Prix

And this ain't a simple journey, no way I'm slowing down

Do you really think you're worth it? Baby, in your dreams



Busy tryna give it my everything 'cause life's not Disney

I don't need a knight in shining armor

So you gotta respect that I got that X factor

Oh, I'm gonna make it rain, yeah, uh, uh, let's go



Pit-a-pat, my heart is saying

There's a fire, you can't contain it

I don't need a boy to save me

Na-na-na-na-na-na

Pit-a-pat, my heart is saying

It's my dream, I gotta chase it

I don't see that ever changing

Na-na-na-na-na-na



Pit-a-pat, dapat tapat ka

Kalooban mo'y napakaganda

Sa panahong nadadapa ka

Tumayo't tumakbo at 'wag mag-alala

'Di mo na kailangan maghanap ng iba

Na tutulong sa 'yo kapag walang-wala

Kayang-kaya mo 'yan, 'wag na 'wag aatras

'Di kailangan ng prince charming para maligtas



Hey! 'Wag ka nang kabahan

'Di tayo 'yung mga prisensang 'di kayang lumaban

Aww, pasensiya na

Nakalaan ang oras ko sa mga plano at pangarap

For all the girls out there, we can make this worth it

We ain't gonna back down, we ain't gonna quit

'Di man madali, maniwala sa sarili

Pit-a, patuloy lumaban at ika'y magwawagi



Maybe one day, I'll be down

To let somebody in, even stick around

Could be you I'm leaning on

But right now I'm looking out for number one



Busy tryna give it my everything 'cause life's not Disney

I don't need a knight in shining armor

So you gotta respect that I got that X factor

Oh, I'm gonna make it rain, yeah, uh, uh, let's go



Pit-a-pat, pintig ng puso

Lumiliyab ang damdamin ko

Seryoso 'to, hindi 'to biro

Na-na-na-na-na-na

Pit-a-pat, pintig ng puso

Uunahin ang mga pangarap ko

Ito'y hindi na magbabago

Na-na-na-na-na-na
