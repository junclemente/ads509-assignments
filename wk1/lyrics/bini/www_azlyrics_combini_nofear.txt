"No Fear"

BINI!



I'm feeling like I can't lose

I won't let you get in my away

Over and over, I'll prove

I'm showing no fear, I'm showing no fear

We're here just here to have a good time (Let's go)



I'm high in the clouds

That's a new level, what a good flight (Oh-oh, oh-oh)

No trouble around, we don't stress no one

Just a good time (Oh-oh, ooh-woah)



And I won't let you take me down

Or change my mind, I'm looking at better days

I will always hold my ground and stand up right

I putting on my game face



I'm feeling like I can't lose

I won't let you get in my away

Over and over, I'll prove

I'm showing no fear, I'm showing no fear

We're here just here to have a good time



Ooh-woah, ooh-woah

I'm showing no fear, I'm showing no fear

Ooh-woah, ooh-woah

I'm showing no fear, I'm showing no fear



So don't mind the doubt

You can do whatever, as long as you try (Oh-oh, oh-oh)

No matter if you're down, get up

'Cause it's alright (Oh-oh, ooh-woah)



And I won't let you take me down

Or change my mind, I'm looking at better days

I will always hold my ground and stand up right

I putting on my game face



I'm feeling like I can't lose

I won't let you get in my away

Over and over, I'll prove

I'm showing no fear, I'm showing no fear

We're here just here to have a good time



Ooh-woah, ooh-woah

I'm showing no fear, I'm showing no fear

Ooh-woah, ooh-woah

I'm showing no fear, I'm showing no fear



Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh

I'm showing no fear



Ooh-woah, ooh-woah

I'm showing no fear, I'm showing no fear

Ooh-woah, ooh-woah

I'm showing no fear, I'm showing no fear

I'm showing no fear
