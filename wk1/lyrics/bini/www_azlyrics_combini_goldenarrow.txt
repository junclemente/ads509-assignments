"Golden Arrow"

Alright

Hey, yeah

Let's go



Think I've lost my keys again

Madness out the door

It's a Friday night, I'm wishing for a little more

Under streetlights 8 PM, let's make this one count

No one else but me and my girls

Running this whole town



Grab the ice cream, go turn the clock

Dance 'til midnight, nobody knock

Everybody watch out a storm is coming your way

Warning signs and flashing lights

All of the clichÃ©s

Feeling a little nervous with this moments in our hands

Got nothing to worry about

Time to take the chance



We got, we got, we got tonight, to borrow

We got, we got, we got this golden arrow

Grab the ice cream, go turn the clock

Dance 'til midnight, nobody knock

We got, we got, we got this golden arrow



I like it

Let's go



You can bet, we own the world

Crown is on our heads (Yeah)

Go check out the rules and see

Nothing to be said (Nothing to be said)

In our own world 1 AM

Perfect harmony (Hey)

No one else but me and my girls (Me and my girls)

Making our legacy



Grab the ice cream, go turn the clock

Dance 'til midnight, nobody knock

Everybody watch out a storm is coming your way (La-la-la)

Warning signs and flashing lights

All of the clichÃ©s (Oh)

Feeling a little nervous with this moments in our hands (In our hands)

Got nothing to worry about

Time to take the chance



We got, we got, we got tonight, to borrow

We got, we got, we got this golden arrow

Grab the ice cream, go turn the clock

Dance 'til midnight, nobody knock

We got, we got, we got this golden arrow



I gotta take a minute, gotta catch my breath

I don't care about these limits, ready for your tests

I got no time, no dime for nothing else

I got beauty, got strength, I'm the beast of my belle

Now it's my time to, pierce my way through

With this golden arrow, ain't ever be wasted

Yeah, I'm pushing and pushing when I'm on the edge, huh

Fightin' and fightin' 'til I got nothin' left



I go-go-gotta just be carefree, just ignore the bad energy

Nobody can stop me 'cause the star belongs to me

I placed the crown on my head and told myself

This is my shot, watch me I can make it, I can do it (That's right!)

Working hard to get to the top

Hope is on the horizon, we BINI ain't gonna stop

Take your aim, make your mark, fix your eyes on the price

Don't stop believin, hold the feelin', this fire within

Is why we're born to win (Woah, oh)



We got, we got, we got tonight, to borrow (We got tonight)

We got, we got, we got this golden arrow (Got this golden arrow)

Grab the ice cream, go turn the clock (Yeah)

Dance 'til midnight, nobody knock (Yeah)

We got, we got, we got this golden arrow (Oh)



We got, we got, we got tonight, to borrow (Yeah-eh)

We got, we got, we got this golden arrow (We got this arrow)

Grab the ice cream, go turn the clock

Dance 'til midnight, nobody knock

We got, we got, we got this golden arrow (Oh)
