"Blink Twice"

I heard you like confidence

Well, I've got a lot of it

So baby, use common sense

Just don't be anonymous

I heard that you've been busy, yeah

I heard it through the grapevine

Trying my best not to step up on your landmine

But let's have some fun with it

'Cause you know I'm runnin' it



Ooh, ooh

I'm lost inside your world, you got that symphony

Like da-doo, da-doo, da-doo



If you like me, blink twice

Are you naughty or nice?

Maybe add a little spice

If you're tryna roll the dice (Dice)

Let me give you some advice

If you like me, blink twice, oh, oh



Ooh, ooh

He's not even thinkin' 'bout me

Ooh, ooh

Maybe he's just lookin' at me



Got me goin' crazy, baby, no, don't be lazy

Come over and chase me, yeah, you better amaze me

I'm at the spot

Baby, tell me, are you ready or not?

Don't you leave me waitin'



Ooh, ooh

I'm lost inside your world, you got that symphony

Like da-doo, da-doo, da-doo



If you like me, blink twice

Are you naughty or nice?

Maybe add a little spice

If you're tryna roll the dice (Dice)

Let me give you some advice

If you like me, blink twice, oh, oh



Ooh, ooh

He's not even thinkin' 'bout me

Ooh, ooh

Maybe he's just lookin' at me



If you, you really like me

Baby, then just blink twice

If you, you really like me

Then you gotta roll the dice



If you like me, blink twice

Are you naughty or nice?

Maybe add a little spice

If you're tryna roll the dice

Let me give you some advice

If you like me, blink twice, oh, oh



Ooh, ooh

He's not even thinkin' 'bout me

Ooh, ooh

Maybe he's just lookin' at me

Ooh, ooh

He's not even thinkin' 'bout me

Ooh, ooh

Maybe he's just lookin' at me



Maybe he's just lookin' at me
