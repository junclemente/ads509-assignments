"Here With You"

I saw the line of a thousand other dreams coming true

Nervous faces and heart races

Can I come through?

Used to dance on my own

Thought I was all alone

Then I found your new faces

Now I know where my place is



When the world was telling me, "No"

You pushed my heart to just go

And now for sure, I know



Now here with you, found something new

Through the dark nights, the highlights

You're my lifeline, as we take our flight

Let's paint the sky in different lights

Holding onto all that we could be

Gonna make it bright



Woah, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh

Woah, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh

Woah, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh

Woah, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh



Opened our eyes, to the rain coming down on sunny days

Sacrifices, compromises

Do we like the view?

Would've want to quit the show

But with you, we've got a reason to keep going on this road

Now we know where our place is



When the world was telling me, "No"

You pushed my heart to just go

And now for sure, we know



Now here with you, found something new (Now here with you)

Through the dark nights, the highlights (Woah, ooh, woah, ooh, oh, oh)

You're my lifeline, as we take our flight (You're my lifeline)

Let's paint the sky in different lights

Holding onto all that we could be

Gonna make it bright



And no matter what they say to break us, take our spirits down

We just need to look around



Now here with you (Yeah, yeah)

Found something new (Found something new)

Through the dark nights, the highlights (Ooh, woah)

You're my lifeline, as we take our flight (Ooh, woah)

Let's paint the sky in different lights (Let's paint the sky, ooh)

Holding onto all that we could be (All that we could be)

Gonna make it bright



Now here with you (Oh, oh)

Found something new (Oh, oh)

Through the dark nights (Oh), the highlights (Hey)

You're my lifeline, as we take our flight (Take a flight)

Let's paint the sky in different lights (Ah-ah)

Holding onto all that we could be

Gonna make it bright (Gonna make it bright)



Woah, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh

Woah, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh

Woah, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh

Woah, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh

Woah, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh

Woah, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh

Woah, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh

Woah, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh
