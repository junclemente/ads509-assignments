"OXYGEN"

Woke up, thank God

Didn't think I would make it this far

Last night, close call

But I'm still singing na, na, na, na, na



Blue skies and red lights

These good times

Are more than a feeling

You put a smile on my lips



Feels like oxygen, woah

And it's a head rush

Every time I breathe you in, woah

I can't get enough, babe, it feels like oxygen



La, la, la, feels like oxygen

La, la, la, feels like oxygen

Oh, oh, lift your head



Woke up, thank God (Baby, don't be scared)

Didn't think I would make it this far

You'll get along with a little prayer and a song

So I'm singing na, na, na, na, na



Blue skies and red lights

These good times

Are more than a feeling

It's a wonder love can make the world go

Round and round and round



Feels like oxygen, woah

And it's a head rush

Every time I breathe you in, woah

I can't get enough, babe, it feels like oxygen (Something about me around you)



La, la, la, feels like oxygen (Something about me around you)

La, la, la, feels like oxygen



Lovin' myself, livin' mah life, feelin' good

Feelin' never tired got me rollin', rollin'

Humingang malalim makinig ka sa'min

Listen to the beat, let's dance and dance



Life is amazing, no one can stop ya

Ain't no wasting, keepin' the fire

If ya wanna feel this forever

Never be scared, find ya O-X-Y-gen



Feels like oxygen

Feels like oxygen

Feels like oxygen

Something about me around you

Something about me around you



Oh, feels like oxygen, woah

And it's a head rush

Every time I breathe you in, woah

I can't get enough, babe, it feels like oxygen (Something about me around you)



La, la, la, feels like oxygen (Something about me around you)

La, la, la, feels like oxygen
