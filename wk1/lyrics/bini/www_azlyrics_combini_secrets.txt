"Secrets"

Something's up, I can see it written on your face you know

What's it now? Whatcha thinking?

Wondering why you can't let it go?

Lately you can't get it off your mind

Don't know what you feel and it's not enough

You can talk to me and we can work this out (This out)



Oh, I don't seem to get you, oh

Are you hiding something from me, baby? (Ooh, oh)

Tell me, tell, tell it all to me now

Tell, tell it all to me now

Ooh, I wanna show you that you can



Tell me all your secrets

Promise I will keep 'em

Just trust me, you can trust me boy

Speak, let me hear your voice

Tell me all your secrets

Promise I will keep 'em

I'm not playing, trust me boy

If you're with me make some noise



I see it's troubling you, I see it's eating you up

I see whatever you do, it ain't letting you off

Gonna hold inside? Let your tongue stay tied?

Never let words slide?

Is it all because of the past that you had?

Is that why you cannot talk to me?

Just can't think of no reasons

Just to let you know you're safe with me



Oh, I don't seem to get you, oh

Are you hiding something from me, baby? Ooh, oh

Tell me, tell, tell it all to me now

Tell, tell it all to me now

Ooh, I wanna show you that you can



Tell me all your secrets

Promise I will keep 'em

Just trust me, you can trust me boy

Speak, let me hear your voice

Tell me all your secrets

Promise I will keep 'em

I'm not playing, trust me boy

If you're with me make some noise



Tell, tell, te-tell me boy (Ayy)

Tell, tell, te-tell me boy

Tell, tell, te-tell me boy (Ayy)

Tell, tell, te-tell me boy



Is it something about me?

Have I done something lately?

Did I say anything to make you feel this way?

Just know that with me by your side

No need to worry

You don't have to hide, ohh



Tell me all your secrets

Promise I will keep 'em

Just know you can trust me, if you're all alone you can call me

Tell me all your secrets

Promise I will keep 'em

You know you can trust me, I'm not lying

You can count on me, oh (That's right)

Deep inside I know (Ohh)

You tryna hide it all keeping your thoughts in limitation (Ayy)

Tell, tell, te-tell me boy (Tell me, tell me baby)

Tell, tell, te-tell me boy

If you need someone to listen to your own feelings (Yeah)

I'm reminding you, baby, you can trust me, mmm

Tell, tell, te-tell me boy

Tell, tell, te-tell me boy
