[Romanized:]



Lovesick girls

Lovesick girls



Eien ni zutto

Deguchi tozashita mama no love (Love)

What can we say?

Itami ni hirei suru love (Love)



Nani o shinji yoga

Ai no kizu ni donna imi mo nai to hanarete

Hora iyake sasudesho

Kecchaku doki yo genkaine chotto itami ni kitai no sedo



Takaga isshundakedo doa

Nani o sagashi samayou no ka

But I don't care, I'll do it over and over

Atashitachi eien ni shiyoune



We are the lovesick girls

Nee katte ni owarasenaiyo zutto

We are the lovesick girls

Itami o shitte wakaru imi wa kitto



But we were born to be alone

Yeah, we were born to be alone

Yeah, we were born to be alone

But why we still looking for love?



No love letters, no X and O's

No love, never, my exes know

No diamond rings, that set in stone

To the left, better left alone

Didn't wanna be a princess, I'm priceless

A prince not even on my list

Love is a drug that I quit

No doctor could help when I'm lovesick



Takaga isshundakedo doa

Nani o sagashi samayou no ka

Fuanna me haita no ga kimi da

Itakute mo eien ni isshone



We are the lovesick girls

Nee katte ni owarasenaiyo zutto

We are the lovesick girls

Itami o shitte wakaru imi wa kitto



But we were born to be alone

Yeah, we were born to be alone

Yeah, we were born to be alone

But why we still looking for love?



Ai wa slippin' and fallin'

Ai wa killin' your darlin'

Kizuga ieta atowa zen'bu wasureruhodoni

Kikoenai what you say

Itami dake shiawase

Kanashi me o suru kimi no hou ga kawai soude



We are the lovesick girls

Nee katte ni owarasenaiyo zutto

We are the lovesick girls

Itami o shitte wakaru imi wa kitto



One, two



(Lovesick girls) Douse hanarete mo

(Lovesick girls) Namida ga karete mo

(Lovesick girls) Itami gomakashite mo

(Lovesick girls)

But we're still looking for love

[English translation:]



Lovesick girls

Lovesick girls



Forever eternal

Love remains in a closed exit (Love)

What can we say?

Love is proportional to pain (Love)



No matter what you believe

The torn wounds of love have no meaning

Look, I'm sick

The limit is settled

I'm expecting a little pain



It's a mere moment

I'm wandering around, looking for a door

But I don't care, I'll do it over and over

We'll be together forever



We are the lovesick girls

Hey, I won't end it on my own

We are the lovesick girls

I understand what it means to know pain



But we were born to be alone

Yeah, we were born to be alone

Yeah, we were born to be alone

But why we still looking for love?



No love letters, no X and O's

No love, never, my exes know

No diamond rings, that set in stone

To the left, better left alone

Didn't wanna be a princess, I'm priceless

A prince not even on my list

Love is a drug that I quit

No doctor could help when I'm lovesick



It's a mere moment

I'm wandering around, looking for a door

I had anxious eyes

You're the one hurting, but I'll be with you forever



We are the lovesick girls

Hey, I won't end it on my own

We are the lovesick girls

I understand what it means to know pain



But we were born to be alone

Yeah, we were born to be alone

Yeah, we were born to be alone

But why we still looking for love?



Love is slippin' and fallin'

Love is killin' your darlin'

After the wound has healed, I forget everything

I can't hear what you say

Only the pain is happy

Your sad eyes are more pitiful



We are the lovesick girls

Hey, I won't end it on my own

We are the lovesick girls

I understand what it means to know pain



One, two



(Lovesick girls) Even if you leave

(Lovesick girls) Even if my tears die

(Lovesick girls) Even if you deceive the pain

(Lovesick girls)

But we're still looking for love
