"You Never Know (Japanese Version)"

[Romanized:]



Egao-tsukuri kyÅhane

Yoru ga kurai na

It keeps bringing me down down down



Araku hanatta kotoba

SonÅchi todoku ka na

I've heard enough I've heard enough

Of the things that I'm not



Toki nagarete mo

Kawaranai watashi

Yume ni mi teta michi o aruku no

Anomama no

Sonomama no

Ne~e mainichi odotta

Ano basho ni iru nda, ima mo



But you'll never know unless you walk in my shoes

You'll never know mo tsurete iku

'Cause everybody sees what they wanna see

It's easier to judge me than to believe



Oku no kata ni aru omoi

Tamani kurushimete kuru nÄ

SÅ, mottoImma shine baby

You know they ain't got a shot on me



Sunday night I've been swallowed by my bed

I've been all over my head

Wonderin' if I gotta trying pretend

Jibun mo shiranai

Kedo dareka ni

Kitai shite iru jibun ga kowai no



Hikari ga tsuyoi hodo

Nobite iku kono kage

Mabushi sugitanara

Watashi, mireru ka na



Toki nagarete mo

Kawaranai watashi

Yume ni mi teta michi o aruku no

Anomama no

Sonomama no

Ne~e mainichi odotta

Ano basho ni iru nda, ima mo



But you'll never know unless you walk in my shoes

You'll never know mo tsurete iku

'Cause everybody sees what they wanna see

It's easier to judge me than to believe



Oku no kata ni aru omoi

Tamani kurushimete kuru nÄ

SÅ, mottoImma shine baby

You know they ain't got a shot on me



Shizundara dameda yo

Wakatteru

Utsumuite mo tobenai yo

Hora, kumo no mukÅ

Akarui ne



Egaite yabutte

Sore datte subetewo

Karappo ni shite waraeru yo ni

Jibun to mukiatte



Oboe teru

So I'll be okay

Ippai hanagasaku-yÅ

You know I'll always be waiting



But you'll never know unless you walk in my shoes

You'll never know mo tsurete iku

'Cause everybody sees what they wanna see

It's easier to judge me than to believe



Oku no kata ni aru omoi

Tamani kurushimete kuru nÄ



SÅ, mottoImma shine baby

You know they ain't got a shot on me
