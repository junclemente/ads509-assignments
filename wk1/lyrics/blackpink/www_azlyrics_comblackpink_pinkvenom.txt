"Pink Venom"

[Romanized:]



Kick in the door, waving the coco

Papkonina chaenggyeo kkyeodeul saenggak malgo

I talk that talk, runways I walk walk

Nun gamkko pop pop an bwado cheok



One by one then two by two

Nae sonkkeut tuk hanae da muneojineun jung

Gatja sho chigon hwaryeohaetji

Makes no sense, you couldn't get a dollar outta me



Ja oneul bamiya

Nan dogeul pumeun kkot

Ni honeul ppaeaseun daeum

Look what you made us do

Cheoncheonhi neol jamjaeul Fire

Janinhal mankeum areumdaweo

I bring the pain like



This that pink venom

This that pink venom

This that pink venom

Get 'em, get 'em, get 'em

Straight to ya dome like whoa whoa whoa

Straight to ya dome like ah ah ah



Taste that pink venom

Taste that pink venom

Taste that pink venom

Get 'em, get 'em, get 'em

Straight to ya dome like whoa whoa whoa

Straight to ya dome like ah ah ah



Black paint and ammo, got bodies like Rambo

Rest in peace, please light up a candle

This da life of a vandal, masked up and I'm still in Celine

Designer crimes or it wouldn't be me



Diamonds shinin' drive in silence

I don't mind it I'm ridin'

Flyin' private side by side with da pilot up in the sky

And I'm wildin', stylin' on them and there's no chance

Cuz we got bodies on bodies like this a slow dance

[English translation:]



Kick in the door, waving the coco

Eat your popcorn don't think about cutting in

I talk that talk, runways I walk walk

Eyes closed pop pop no need to look



One by one then two by two

Everything collapses at the flick of my fingertip

Quite fancy for a fake show

Makes no sense, you couldn't get a dollar outta me



It's tonight

I'm a flower with venom

After taking your soul

Look what you made us do

The fire that'll slowly put you to sleep

So beautiful it's brutal

I bring the pain like



This that pink venom

Get 'em, get 'em, get 'em

Rest in peace, please light up a candle

And I'm wildin', stylin' on them and there's no chance

Provoke us if you'd like

You can't handle it and you know this

Already spread, shot that potion

Pink ocean right before your eyes



Come and give me all the smoke

All or nothing, like I'm so rock and roll

Come and give me all the smoke

Line 'em up, stop drop
