But we were born to be alone

Yeah, we were born to be alone

Yeah, we were born to be alone

But why we still looking for love?



No love letters, no X and O's

No love never, my exes know

No diamond rings that set in stone

To the left, better left alone



Didn't wanna be a princess, I'm priceless

A prince not even on my list

Love is a drug that I quit

No doctor could help when I'm lovesick

[English translation:]



Endless night

Love trapped us in a windowless room (Love)

What can we say?

Long for love even though it hurts every time (Love)



Get hurt and break down, I

Don't know what's keeping me to hold on

If I leave anyway, I'll hate you in my pained state

We can't end it before it's over

It's as if we've been waiting for this agony



Maybe it's all just for a moment

What are we looking for so aimlessly



But I don't care I'll do it over and over

I just need you in my life



We are the lovesick girls

You can't just end this love on your own

We are the lovesick girls

I'm nothing without this pain



But we were born to be alone

Yeah we were born to be alone

Yeah, we were born to be alone

But why we still looking for love



No love letters, no X and O's

No love, never, my exes know

No diamond rings, that set in stone

To the left, better left alone



Didn't wanna be a princess, I'm priceless

A prince not even on my list

Love is a drug that I quit

No doctor could help when I'm lovesick



Maybe it's all just for a moment

What are we looking for so aimlessly



Looking at you with my anxious gaze

You're all I need even if it hurts



We are the lovesick girls

You can't just end this love on your own

We are the lovesick girls

I'm nothing without this pain



But we were born to be alone

Yeah, we were born to be alone

Yeah, we were born to be alone

But why we still looking for love



Love is slippin' and fallin'

Love is killin' your darlin'

That fearless thrill returns once the pain subsides



Can't hear what you say

I'm happy with this pain

You pity me, but I pity you more for pitying me



We are the lovesick girls

You can't just end this love on your own

We are the lovesick girls

I'm nothing without this pain



One, two



Lovesick girls

Everyone eventually leaves

Lovesick girls

I've become numb from crying

Lovesick girls

Hurt over and over again

Lovesick girls

But we're still looking for love
