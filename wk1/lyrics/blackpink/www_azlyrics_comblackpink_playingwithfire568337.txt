"PLAYING WITH FIRE (Japanese Version)"

[Romanized:]




[Jennie, Jisoo:]

Mama ni itsumo iwarete ta no

Otoko ni wa kiwotsukete

Koi wa hiasobi mi tai de

Kega suru kara ne

Mama wa itsumo tadashikatta

Kimi to au tabi atsuku naru nda

Kowa sa yori hikareru kimi ni

Kogarete




[RosÃ©, Lisa:]

Furueru koi

Kokoro wa On and on and on

Kimi ni sasage tai watashi no subetewo

Look at me look at me now

Kimi no sei da, yakedo shi chau

Kese nai




[RosÃ©, Jennie, Lisa:]

Kono koi wa buljangnan

My love is on fire, ooh

Now burn baby burn

Buljangnan

My love is on fire

So don't play with me boy

Buljangnan




[Lisa:]

Oh no Ima sara hikikaesenaino

Mohaya tannaru asobi jyanaino

Got me fired up I'm burning

I don't even want it, can't stop it's urgent

I ain't never had nobody do it better

But oh no you're bad, really bad but...

BOY I'm LOCO!

Show 'em out, smoke 'em out, match scratch lighter

Kiss him, will I diss him I don't know but I miss him

Flame in my veins this love is like crack

Can you feel my heart go black?




[Jennie, Jisoo:]

Furueru koi

Kokoro wa On and on and on

[English Translation:]




[Jennie, Jisoo:]

Momma always told me

Take care around men

Love wants to see fire

I'm injured

Mama was always right

It's getting hotter as I meet with you

To you, who I'm, scarily attracted to

Get burned




[RosÃ©, Lisa:]

This trembling love

My heart is On and on and on

I want to dedicate all of me to you

Look at me look at me now

It is because of you, I get burned

I can not dispense of you




[RosÃ©, Jennie, Lisa:]

This love is burning up

My love is on fire, ooh

Now burn baby burn

Burning up

My love is on fire

So don't play with me boy

Burning up




[Lisa:]

Oh no I can not turn back now

It is no longer just a bit of fun

Got me fired up I'm burning

I don't even want it, can't stop it's urgent

I ain't never had nobody do it better

But oh no you're bad, really bad, but...

BOY I'm LOCO!

Show 'em out, smoke 'em out, match scratch lighter

Kiss him, will I diss him I don't know but I miss him

Flame in my veins this love is like crack

Can you feel my heart go black?

My love is on fire, ooh

Now burn baby burn

Burning up

Burning up




[Jennie, RosÃ©:]

I can no longer hold

This fire, spreading at tremendous speed

(RosÃ©) Hey, don't make it stop

Burn it to ashes

Whooo
