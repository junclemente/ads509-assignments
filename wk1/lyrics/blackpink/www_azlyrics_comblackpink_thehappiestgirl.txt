"The Happiest Girl"

Don't hold my hand

Don't beg me back

Don't say that we'll make it through this

If I'm so beautiful then, why?



The doors we slammed

The plates we smashed

Echo with the sound of madness

I can't remember why we try



My heart only wants you

The moment you say no



But tonight, I'll be the happiest girl in the world

You'll see like it doesn't matter

Tonight, I'll be the happiest girl in the world

You'll see like it never happened



I can stop the tears if I want to

I can stop the tears if I want to

I can stop the tears if I want to



But tonight, I'll be the happiest girl in the world

You'll see like it never happened



Don't make us saints

We're wards of pain

The past and a perfect picture

There's no one else to blame this time



Don't change the truth

We can't undo the high, we chase steal the crash, no

You're not the one, who gets to cry



My heart only wants you

The moment you say no



But tonight, I'll be the happiest girl in the world

You'll see like it doesn't matter

Tonight, I'll be the happiest girl in the world

You'll see like it never happened



I can stop the tears if I want to

I can stop the tears if I want to

I can stop the tears if I want to



But tonight, I'll be the happiest girl in the world

You'll see like it never happened



All it takes is a smooth pop of a bottle top to fix a heart

A broken heart, baby



All it takes is a little rolling paper take us to the start

Go back to the start



But tonight, I'll be the happiest girl in the world

You'll see like it doesn't matter

Tonight, I'll be the happiest girl in the world

You'll see like it never happened



I can stop the tears if I want to

I can stop the tears if I want to

I can stop the tears if I want to



But tonight, I'll be the happiest girl in the world

You'll see like it never happened
