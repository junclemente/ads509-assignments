"Kill This Love (Japanese Version)"

[Romanized:]



Tenshi ga said hi

Kekka akuma said bye

ShÅki ja muri so high

Hai chau kurai no price

Kotae no nai test

Damasarete mo yes

Zutto kanjÅ no dorei

Mu kachina ai ne



Here I come kick in the door

Act like I'm buyin' the store

You better give me some love

Bitch, fill it up give me some more

Feelin' like I think that I need to pray

But you need it more

Lord give me the strength

'Cause I'm at my limit and in just one minute

You gonna be visitin' heaven but might not get in it



Look at me look at you

KurushÄ«? Dotchiga

You smart dare? you are

RyÅme namida aka ni shitara

So sorry dare? you are



DÅshite nakanai yÅ ni shite mo...

Isso no koto-me o fuse

Kono ai todome sasu kitto



Let's kill this love

Yeah yeah yeah

Rum pum pum pum pum pum pum

Let's kill this love

Rum pum pum pum pum pum pum



Feelin' like a sinner

It's so fire with him I go boo hoo



He said you look crazy

Thank you baby

I owe it all to you



Got me all messed up

His love is my favorite



But you plus me sadly can be dangerous



Lucky me lucky you

KyÅgen no naka we lie

So what so what

Mashite kimi o jogai shitara

So sorry

I'm not sorry



DÅshite nakanai yÅ ni shite mo...

Isso no koto-me o fuse

Kono ai todome sasu kitto



Let's kill this love

Yeah yeah yeah

Rum pum pum pum pum pum pum

Let's kill this love

Rum pum pum pum pum pum pum



We all commit to love

That makes you cry

We're all making love

That kills you inside, yeah

Gotta kill this love

Before it kills you too

Kill this love
