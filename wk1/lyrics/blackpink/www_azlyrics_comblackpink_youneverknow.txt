"You Never Know"

[Romanized:]



Aesseoseo hwaljjak useotdeon nare

Bameun wae deo eoduulkka

It keeps bringing me down, down, down



Modu neomu swipge naebaetdeon mal

Ama deulligetji meojiana

I've heard enough, I've heard enough

Of the things that I'm not



On sesangi bakkwieogado

Ajik naneun geudaeron geol

Naega georeoganeun I gireul kkumkkudeon

Geuttae geudaero

Geuttae geudaero

Nae maeireul chumchudeon

Cheoeum geu jarie nama inneun geol



But you'll never know unless you walk in my shoes

You'll never know eongkyeobeorin nae kkeun

'Cause everybody sees what they wanna see

It's easier to judge me than to believe



Gipi sumgyeotdeon nalgeun saenggakdeul

Gakkeum nareul japgo goeropijiman

Geureolsurok I'ma shine, baby

You know they ain't got a shot on me



Sunday night I've been swallowed by my bed

I've been all over my head

Wonderin' if I gotta try and pretend

Nado jal moreuneun nal

Nuga arajugil gidaehaneun nae moseubeul chajeulkka duryeowo



Jeo bichi deo balgajilsurok

Nae geurimjado gireojineunde

Neomu nuni busyeool ttae

Nan dwireul bol su isseulkka



On sesangi bakkwieogado

Ajik naneun geudaeron geol

Naega georeoganeun I gireul kkumkkudeon

Geuttae geudaero

Geuttae geudaero

Nae maeireul chumchudeon

Cheoeum geu jarie nama inneun geol



But you'll never know unless you walk in my shoes

You'll never know eongkyeobeorin nae kkeun

'Cause everybody sees what they wanna see

It's easier to judge me than to believe



Gipi sumgyeotdeon nalgeun saenggakdeul

Gakkeum nareul japgo goeropijiman

Geureolsurok I'ma shine, baby

You know they ain't got a shot on me



Garaanjeumyeon an dwae

Nado jal ara

Ttangman boneun chaeron nal su eopseo

Gureum geonneopyeonen

Ajik balgeun hae



Naega geuryeo watdeon geurim soge

Jjijeobeorin gotdeulkkaji

Da biwonaego useul su itge

Bogi sileotdeon nawa majuhallae



Nan gieokae

So I'll be okay

Paran nae bang hangadeuk kkochi pige

Know I'll always be waiting



But you'll never know unless you walk in my shoes

You'll never know eongkyeobeorin nae kkeun

'Cause everybody sees what they wanna see

It's easier to judge me than to believe



Gipi sumgyeotdeon nalgeun saenggakdeul

Gakkeum nareul japgo goeropijiman

Geureolsurok I'ma shine, baby

You know they ain't got a shot on me

[English translation:]



On the day when I laughed hard

Why is the night darker?

It keeps bringing me down, down, down



Hmm, the words that everyone said so easily

Maybe you can hear it soon

I've heard enough I've heard enough

Of the things that I'm not



Even if the whole world changes

I'm still the same

I dreamed of this path I walked

As it was then, as it was then

The first time I danced every day

I was left there



But you'll never know unless you walk in my shoes

You'll never know, my tangled strings

'Cause everybody sees what they wanna see

It's easier to judge me than to believe



The old thoughts I hid deeply

Sometimes grabbing me and tormenting me

The more I do, I'mma shine baby

You know they ain't got a shot on me



Sunday night, I've been swallowed by my bed

I've been all over my head

Wonderin' if I gotta try and pretend

I don't know what day it is

I'm afraid I'll find myself hoping to know



The brighter that light gets

My shadow is getting longer

When it's too dazzling

Will I be able to see behind you?



Even if the whole world changes

I'm still the same

I dreamed of this path I walked

As it was then, as it was then

The first time I danced every day

I was left there



But you'll never know unless you walk in my shoes

You'll never know, my tangled strings

'Cause everybody sees what they wanna see

It's easier to judge me than to believe



The old thoughts I hid deeply

Sometimes grabbing me and tormenting me

The more I do, I'mma shine baby

You know they ain't got a shot on me



You can't sink, I know well

I can't fly while looking at the ground

Across the clouds, it's still bright

I've been drawing in the picture



Even in the torn places

So I can empty everything and laugh

I wanna face me, who I didn't want to see



I remember, so I'll be okay

Make flowers bloom in my blue room

Know I'll always be waiting



But you'll never know unless you walk in my shoes

You'll never know, my tangled strings

'Cause everybody sees what they wanna see

It's easier to judge me than to believe



The old thoughts I hid deeply

Sometimes grabbing me and tormenting me

The more I do, I'ma shine baby

You know they ain't got a shot on me
