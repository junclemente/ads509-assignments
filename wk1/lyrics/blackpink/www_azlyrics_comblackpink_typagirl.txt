"Typa Girl"

Typa girl that'll make you wanna dream (Shake, shake)

Typa girl that came straight off of the screen (Screen, screen)

Typa girl you wanna ice up, make me freeze (Ha, ha)

Typa girl you wanna wife up, sign the pre



I bring money to the table, not your dinner

Both my body and my bank account, good figure

Thinking 'bout me, but there's nothing to consider

If I let you in my circle, you a winner



Didn't know that you were cold 'til you felt my fire

Heaven's gate just opened up, hearing choirs

If you saying something else, you a liar



'Cause I'm that girl that drive you crazy, but you can't leave me alone

Got you thinking maybe, I went supernatural

Put you under spells or look into a crystal ball

I'm not like these other girls at all

I'm the typa girl that make you forget that you got a type

Type that make you love me when the only thing you done is like

I'm that typa girl, I'm that typa girl

I'm that typa girl, I'm that typa girl



Like du-du-dun, du-lu-lu-lun

Like du-du-dun, du-lu-lu-lun



Uh, I'm the type of girl that everybody type

Double tap, tap, tap what everybody like

You can check my stats, got everybody's eye

And I run them laps, 'round everybody's mind

All of these girls on some uppercase shit

That mean they all cap

Being the best at whatever I do

That's sounding on brand



Typa girl that you wish for when you blow that candle out

Typa girl that you wanna take back to your mama house

Typa girl that don't ask for what she wants, she's takin' out

Typa girl who got bag in same quality as Chanel



Now you know that you were cold 'cause you felt my fire

Heaven's gate just opened up, hearing choirs

If you saying something else, you a liar



'Cause I'm that girl that drive you crazy, but you can't leave me alone

Got you thinking maybe, I went supernatural

Put you under spells or look into a crystal ball

I'm not like these other girls at all

I'm the typa girl that make you forget that you got a type

Type that make you love me when the only thing you done is like

I'm that typa girl, I'm that typa girl

I'm that typa girl, I'm that typa girl



Like du-du-dun, du-lu-lu-lun

Like du-du-dun, du-lu-lu-lun
