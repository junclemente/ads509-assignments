[English translation:]



Can someone stop time for a bit

I feel like a big mistake just happened

I tried to laugh it off awkwardly

But I pity myself



I say I am fine but

Don't know what to do without you

I am left alone in this trivial place

I picture your memories, they're blue

People change

Why am I like this

On a pretty day like this

How is everything difficult



Don't know what to do

I don't know what to do without you

Yeah hey hey

I don't know what to do without you

Yeah hey hey

I don't know what to do without

You you you

You know I don't know what to do

Don't know what to do



Like people who came and went

I guess we just weren't meant to be



Wondering if the phone might ring

I hate myself for anticipating uselessly

The tick tock of my clock is

Especially bothering me



I might seem totally fine but

Don't know what to do without you

I wonder if my feelings will be shown in the mirror

The lips I've drawn are blue

I'm comfortable alone

I'm just like that

On a pretty day like this

How is everything difficult



Don't know what to do

I don't know what to do without you

Yeah hey hey

I don't know what to do without you

Yeah hey hey

I don't know what to do without

You you you

You know I don't know what to do

Don't know what to do



I say I am fine but

Don't know what to do without you

I am left alone in this trivial place

I picture your memories, they're blue
