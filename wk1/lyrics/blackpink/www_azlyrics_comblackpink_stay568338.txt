"STAY (Japanese Version)"

[Romanized:]




[RosÃ©:]

Bukiyou na sono kotoba de

Hui ni kizu tsuite

Gomen ne mo nanimo naku

Hitori de jibun hage mashite

Kyou mo mata modo ttewa

Konai kato fuan de

I just want you to stay




[Jennie:]

Kono koro narete kita yo sono mukuchina taido ni

Sorosoro wakareyou to kagami ni tsubuyaku no

Watashi ga ite atarimaede kimirashÄ«i ne

Dakedo stay stay with me




[Jisoo:]

Setsunaku nagareru melody eh eh

Kon'nani naka serunoni

Sono kaori wa amai felony

Demo mada daisukide




[RosÃ©, Jisoo, Jennie:]

Kono makkurana sora ni suikoma re chau mae ni

Ne~e onegaidakara soba kara mÅ hanarenaide yo

DÅshitemo kimijanakya damena no

Soba ni ite stay with me




[Lisa, All, RosÃ©:]

It goes a little something like

Lalalalalala Lalalalalala Lalalalalala

Lalalalalala Lalalalalala Lalalalalala

Eiende wanakute mo Ä«kara

Soba ni ite stay with me




[Jennie:]

I said I wanted you to stay but you're always leavin'

Never tell me where, never tell me what's the reason

When you're gone I can't tell if my heart's even beatin'

Sometimes I think it's just for you that I live and breath in




[Lisa:]

So stay, I know you gotta be tired

When the night gets dark lemme be your fire

In the world full of lies, my only truth is you here's a letter

From me to you




[RosÃ©:]

[English Translation:]




[RosÃ©:]

I'm suddenly hurt by that clumsy word

Sorry to encourage myself alone without anything

I am worried that I won't come back today as well

I just want you to stay




[Jennie:]

I've gotten used to it at that time that attitude

I muster to a mirror soon I will break up

It's natural for me to be yourself

However, stay stay with with me




[Jisoo:]

A melting flowing melody

I can't make you cry like this

The fragrance is sweet felony

But I still love it




[RosÃ©, Jennie:]

Before being sucked into this dark sky

Hey, please don't leave me from your side already

It must not be yours, anyway

Stay with me, stay with me




[Lisa, All, RosÃ©:]

It goes a little something like

Lalalalalala Lalalalalala Lalalalalala

Lalalalalala Lalalalalala Lalalalalala

Because it doesn't have to be eternal

Stay with me with stay with me




[Jennie:]

I said I wanted you to stay but you're always leavin'
