I'm so hot nan neomu yeppeoyo

I'm so fine nan neomu maeryeok isseo

I'm so cool nan neomu meotjeo

I'm so so so hot hot



A little bit of black with a little bit of pink

But ain't none little about this

Been living it big

Your crib could fit in my crib

Pretty as shh

Don't gotta say it no more

Look at my face and they know

They've seen it before

Oh, made it to vogue

Put the pop back in pop at the top

What we rock they all rock, had to stop

Have to shop, keep the swagger on five mil

We the only gang to run the game in high-heels

I'm so fine nan neomu maeryeok isseo

I'm so cool nan neomu meotjeo

I'm so so so hot hot

Why are you staring at me? Why?

Am I that pretty?

I know it already but

All that staring makes me blush

Whenever I go by their side

Boys look back

With all the attention that I feel on my back

What should I do



I'm so hot, I'm so pretty

I'm so fine, I'm so attractive

I'm so cool, I'm so gorgeous

I'm so so so hot hot



A little bit of black with a little bit of pink

But ain't none little about this

Been living it big

Your crib could fit in my crib

Pretty as shh

Don't gotta say it no more

Look at my face and they know

They've seen it before

Oh, made it to vogue

Put the pop back in pop at the top

What we rock they all rock, had to stop

Have to shop, keep the swagger on five mil

We the only gang to run the game in high-heels



I want to live a quiet life

Like other girls

My mom's to blame, she made me this way

My life is so tiresome



I'm so hot, I'm so pretty

I'm so fine, I'm so attractive

I'm so cool, I'm so gorgeous

I'm so so so hot hot



I'm so hot, I'm so pretty

I'm so fine, I'm so attractive

I'm so cool, I'm so gorgeous

I'm so so so hot hot
