"How You Like That (Japanese Version)"

[Romanized:]



BLACKPINK in your area



Hora ochiru no zutto

Soko no nai kono kurayami

Nobashita Ryoute mo

Munashi-sa ni fureta dake



Kono sansan no sekai o light up the sky

Me ni yakitsuke I'll kiss you goodbye

Keshi satte ageru sono egao

Koko kara hana dul ses



Ha, how you like that? (Woo)

You gon' like that, that-that-that, that, that-that-that, that

How you like that? (Bada bing, bada boom, boom boom)

How you like that, that-that-that, that, that-that-that, that?



Now, look at you, now look at me (Uh)

Look at you, now look at me (Uh)

Look at you, now look at me

How you like that?

Now, look at you, now look at me (Uh)

Look at you, now look at me (Uh)

Look at you, now look at me

How you like that?



Your girl need it all and that's a hundred

You can get it back when I don't want it

Karma come and get some

I got too much, too much is just enough

What's up? I'm right back

You need no right back

Plain Jane get hijacked, don't like me?

Then tell me how you like that, like that



Sou dondon to sekai o shine like the stars

Saikou ni iyo I'll kiss you goodbye

Keshi satte ageru sono egao

Koko kara hana dul ses



Ha, how you like that? (Woo)

Kono hane ushinatta watashi wo

Ano yami ni ochita watashi wo

Owaraseba yokatta ne sotto

Look up in the sky

It's a bird, it's a plane
