"Kick It"

[Romanized:]



Gyeolloni mweonde tto geuraeseo

Eojjeogettaneun geonde

I'll break ya break ya heart

Never asked for much

Aesseo noryeok ttawin ma Oh

Shwipge baeteun mal juweo damji ma

I ain't nothing like

The same same girls that you've had

Geurae nan meottaero hae



Eoduun bami nal gamssajiman

Ijeseoya nareul wihaeseo chumeul chul su isseo

Neoran byeogeul neomeoseo

I'll kick it if you're down kick it if you down



Can I kick it

Kamkamhan jeo haneul wie

Hanbatang nallireul chimyeo bureul jireul kkeoya

Can I kick it

Neoraneun sesangeul bushweo beorigo

Na hwanhage nunbusheo beoril kkeoya



And I'm letting it all out

Ireul geon eopjana

Ijen nareul chajeul kkeorago

Na honjayeodo gwaenchana

Bulssanghaehaji ma

Ijen neoreul ijeul kkeorago



Never needed nothing else

Just a lil love from myself

When you couldn't be the one to help

Had to kick it and I did it tell whoever you wanna tell

Get kicked to the curb, ya kicked out

Never kick a girl when she kicked down

Who you gon kiss now

Know you gon miss how I move

From the top to the bottom of my kicks now



Eoduun bami nal gamssajiman

Ijeseoya nareul wihaeseo chumeul chul su isseo

Neoran byeogeul neomeoseo

I'll kick it if you're down kick it if you down



Can I kick it

Kamkamhan jeo haneul wie

Hanbatang nallireul chimyeo bureul jireul kkeoya

Can I kick it

Dapdapan neoye sesangeseo beoseona

Nopi naragal tenikka



I'll kick it how I wanna kick it

No you can't tell me not to kick it

Cause I'm bout to kick it

I'll kick it how I wanna kick it

When I wanna kick it

No you can't tell me not to kick it

Cause I'm bout to kick it



And I'm letting it all out

[English translation:]



So what's the answer

So what are you going to do now

I'll break ya break ya heart

Never asked for much

Don't even try

Don't pick up the words I just tossed around

I ain't nothing like

The same same girls that you've had

Yeah, I just do what I want



The dark night might take me away

But now I can dance for myself

I'll jump over the wall that is you

I'll kick it if you're down kick it if you down



Can I kick it

In the dark sky

I'm going to cause a scene and light it on fire

Can I kick it

I'm going to destroy the world that is you

And shine brightly



And I'm letting it all out

I have nothing to lose

I'm going to find myself

I'm okay being alone

Don't feel bad for me

I'm going to forget you now



Never needed nothing else

Just a lil love from myself

When you couldn't be the one to help

Had to kick it and I did it tell whoever you wanna tell

Get kicked to the curb, ya kicked out

Never kick a girl when she kicked down

Who you gon kiss now

Know you gon miss how I move

From the top to the bottom of my kicks now

I'm going to find myself

I'm okay being alone

Don't feel bad for me

I'm going to forget you now



So what's the answer

So what are you going to do now

I'm leaving your frustrating world

And flying above it



I'll kick it how I wanna kick it

When I wanna kick it

No you can't tell me not to kick it

Cause I'm bout to kick it

I'll kick it how I wanna kick it

When I wanna kick it

No you can't tell me not to kick it

Cause I'm bout to kick it
