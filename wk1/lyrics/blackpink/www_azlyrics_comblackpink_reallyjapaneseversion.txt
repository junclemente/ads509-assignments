"REALLY (Japanese Version)"

[Romanized:]



If you really really love me tsutaete yo

Watashi wo hitorijime shitai to really really

Tokkuni kindansoujou kamo really



If you really really want me chikatte yo

Yosomi shinai to anata wa kitto really really

Hoka no yatsu to wa chigau to really



Ubattemisete yozora no hoshi datte

Toki wo tomete motto soba ni ite ne

"Marude kimi wa diamond mitai da yo ne"

Toka tama ni wa uso demo itte hoshii kamo ne



Tsuriawanai wa sonna ko wa

Kiipu shiteru nara danshari shitemiyou ka

Douse watashi ni tadori tsukukara

Better act like you know what

Better act like you know what



Eyes have been calling me baby

Body been telling me take me

Boys have been saying to date me

Your lips should be saying the same thing

For real what's the deal got a feeling you feeling me

Aye but I don't play with them fakes

Keep it real with me



If you really really love me tsutaete yo

Watashi wo hitorijime shitai to really really

Tokkuni kindansoujou kamo really



If you really really want me chikatte yo

Yosomi shinai to anata wa kitto really really

Ta no yatsu to wa chigau to really



Baigaeshi shichau kisu, odeko ni hoho

Dakara tte gouinsugiru no mo no no

Futari me ga aeba haha hihi hoho

Sabishikatta hibi ni wa sotsugyou ne no more



Yopparatte kidokusuruu shinaide

Iji hatta kotoba wa shinjinaide

Kantan na hanashi ne imeeji shite 1, 2, 3

Oniai na futari ga kasanatteku hitotsu ni



Want a romance like the old times

Want to slow dance when it's show time

Just me and you, and that slow jam that we both like

That playlist, my favorite, so play it, but baby

F a love song I need you to say it say it



If you really really love me tsutaete yo

Watashi wo hitorijime shitai to really really

Tokkuni kindansoujou kamo really



If you really really want me chikatte yo

Yosomi shinai to anata wa kitto really really

Ta no yatsu to wa chigau to really



I gotta know that you're for real

Really really really

I gotta know that you're for real

Really really really

I gotta know that you're for real

Really really really

I gotta know that you're for real

Really really really
