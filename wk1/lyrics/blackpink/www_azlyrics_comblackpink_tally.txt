"Tally"

I say "fuck it" when I feel it

'Cause no one's keepin' tally

I do what I want with who I like

I ain't gon' conceal it

While you talkin' all that shit

I'll be gettin' mine, gettin' mine



Don't apologize for my behavior

If you're offended, I don't care

Starin' at me 'stead of starin' in the mirror

Little weird how



Everybody tells me to play nice

Everybody judge, but looking twice

But my body don't belong to, nah-uh-uh, none of them though

And I'm not gonna change 'cause you say so



I say "fuck it" when I feel it

'Cause no one's keepin' tally

I do what I want with who I like

I ain't gon' conceal it

While you talkin' all that shit

I'll be gettin' mine, gettin' mine

Yeah, I say "fuck it" when I feel it

'Cause no one's keepin' tally

I do what I want with who I like

And I ain't gon' conceal it

I'll just do it like the boys say

I'm gettin' mine, gettin' mine



Told me to play it cool

I break the rules, I'm breakin' hearts in two

Warned me to make the rules

Or play the fool, it ain't that hard to choose

Take apart the do's and don'ts

And lose the won'ts, I'm gettin' mine

Mines is mine, yours is mine

This is mine, get in line



Sometimes, I like to go play dirty

Just like all of the fuck boys do

That's my choice and there's no one I'm hurtin'

But that's not girly



Everybody tells me to play nice

Everybody judge, but looking twice

But my body don't belong to, nah-uh-uh, none of them though

And I'm not gonna change 'cause you say so



I say "fuck it" when I feel it

'Cause no one's keepin' tally

I do what I want with who I like

I ain't gon' conceal it

While you talkin' all that shit

I'll be gettin' mine, gettin' mine

Yeah, I say "fuck it" when I feel it

'Cause no one's keepin' tally

I do what I want with who I like

And I ain't gon' conceal it

I'll just do it like the boys say

I'm gettin' mine, gettin' mine
