"Love To Hate Me"

Love, l-l-love, l-l-love

How you love to hate me



Kinda sad that you always been like that

See me making waves, and you don't like that

Driving through your puddles goin' splish, splash

(Splish, splash, splish, splash)



Stressing over nothing, baby, relax

While you gettin' angry, I'ma kick back

Only thing I think about is big stacks

(Racks, racks)



Negative days, negative nights

Baby, you're wasting all your time



I can't relate, I keep it light

No-no-no drama in my life



Wake up, yeah

Makeup, maybe

I need you, nah

I been good lately

Blowin' up

Workin' busy



You ain't worth my love, if you only love to hate me



Love, l-l-love, l-l-love

How you love to hate me

Love, l-l-love, l-l-love



You ain't worth my love if you only love to hate me



I'ma let you fade into the background

Baby, all my shows are gettin' too loud

Keep on turnin' it up when you want me down



Negative days, negative nights

Baby, you're wasting all your time



I can't relate, I keep it light

No-no-no drama in my life



Wake up, yeah

Makeup, maybe

I need you, nah

I been good lately

Blowin' up

Workin' busy



You ain't worth my love, if you only love to hate me



Love, l-l-love, l-l-love

How you love to hate me

Love, l-l-love, l-l-love



You ain't worth my love if you only love to hate me



Love to hate me, you hate to love me

I'm takin' back what you've taken from me

You're mistaken, honey, this something that

Remind me why I be alone on my own

If I needed you, I'd have you that I know, hold up

I could do bad by myself, don't need help

One of a kind, the hand that I was dealt, like oh well

Felt, Cupid was stupid, I should have knew it

'Cause I been through it, you wouldn't do it if it ain't foolish, stupid



You ain't worth my love, if you only love to hate me



Love, l-l-love, l-l-love

How you love to hate me

Love, l-l-love, l-l-love



You ain't worth my love if you only love to hate me



Love, l-l-love, l-l-love

How you love to hate me

Love, l-l-love, l-l-love



You ain't worth my love if you only love to hate me
