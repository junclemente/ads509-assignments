[English translation:]



BLACKPINK in your area



I crumbled before your eyes

Hit rock bottom and sunk deeper

To grab onto the last bit of hope

I've tried to reach out with both of my hands



Again in this dark place, light up the sky

While looking into your eyes, I'll kiss you goodbye

Laugh all you want while you still can

Because it's about to be your turn 1, 2, 3



Ha how you like that?

You gon' like that that that that that

That that that that

How you like that?

How you like that that that that that

That that that that



Now look at you now look at me

Look at you now look at me

Look at you now look at me

How you like that

Now look at you now look at me

Look at you now look at me

Look at you now look at me

How you like that



Your girl need it all and that's a hundred

10 out of 10 I want what's mine

Karma come and get some

I feel bad but there's nothing I can do

Whats up I'm right back

Cock back the trigger

Plain Jane get hijacked

Don't like me? Then tell me how you like that, like that



In this even darker place shine like the stars

With a smile on my face I'll kiss you goodbye

Laugh all you want while you still can

Because it's about to be your turn 1, 2, 3



Ha how you like that?

You gon' like that that that that that

That that that that

How you like that?

How you like that that that that that

That that that that



Now look at you now look at me

Look at you now look at me

Look at you now look at me

How you like that

Now look at you now look at me

Look at you now look at me

Look at you now look at me

How you like that



The day I fell without my wings

Those dark days where I was trapped

You should've ended me when you had the chance

Look up in the sky it's a bird it's a plane



Bring out your boss bitch

BLACKPINK!
