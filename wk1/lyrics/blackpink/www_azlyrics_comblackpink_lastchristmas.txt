"Last Christmas"

Last Christmas I gave you my heart

But the very next day you gave it away

This year to save me from tears

I'll give it to someone special



Last Christmas I gave you my heart

But the very next day you gave it away

This year to save me from tears

I'll give it to someone special



Once bitten and twice shy

I keep my distance

But you still catch my eye

Tell me baby

Do you recognize me?

Well, it's been a year

It doesn't surprise me



Last Christmas I gave you my heart

But the very next day you gave it away

This year to save me from tears

I'll give it to someone special



Last Christmas I gave you my heart (gave you my heart)

But the very next day you gave it away (gave it away)

This year to save me from tears

I'll give it to someone special
