[English translation:]



It seems similar, we are different to our bones

Even if you are embarrassed, apply it if you lay it on

Born skinny, bitch, even if I gain weight, I'm dry

Calculation is slow, but noticeable



I don't want to talk about popularity, only my mouth hurts

Fuck boys, not my boys

If our name is wrong, it's right

Drip, drip, ice it out, bust it down, top to the bottom



(Oh, oh-oh-oh)

Blackpink

All up in it, make it lit, like

(Oh, oh-oh-oh)

Yeah, we some bitches you can't manage

I do this difficult thing again

We are pretty savage

We some pretty savage



You better run, run, run

You better run, run, run



All my diamonds, they yellow or bright white

Got 'em blind can't find me, I'm outta sight

If you mad stay mad, we not alike (Uh-uh)

S-A-V-A-G-E, keep it pretty, pretty savage



I wore something similar but different from my appearance

If it appears salty, lay the carpet first

I was black, I was pink, I changed my way

Your jealousy is the problem maybe I'm the problem



All up in it, make it rain, like

(Oh, oh-oh-oh)

Yeah, we some bitches you can't manage

I do this difficult thing again

We are pretty savage

We some pretty savage



You better run, run, run

You better run, run, run



All my diamonds, they yellow or bright white

Got 'em blind can't find me, I'm outta sight

If you mad stay mad, we not alike

S-A-V-A-G-E, keep it pretty, pretty savage



Pretty girl

Smile, but not weak

And I wish you would (Wish you would)

The rain and wind blows, the higher it flies

I got nothin' left to say to you

If you want, I'll show you attitude

Even if you don't say anything, you know everything

You know



You look savage and look pretty

Savage (So pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty)

You look savage and look pretty

Savage (So pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty)
