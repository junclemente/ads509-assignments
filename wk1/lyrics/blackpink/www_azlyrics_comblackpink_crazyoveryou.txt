"Crazy Over You"

I been known to kiss and tell

Send girls to wishing wells

If you're my man, I want you to myself



I know I'll have enemies

Long as you're into me

But I don't care 'cause I got what I need



Oh yeah

Need to get with the program

Boy, I keep you close like slow dance

Hit you with that red, don't go there, no-no, man



Met him

Then get him

I make sure we stay

Got the venom

To dead him

If he want a snake

I mean sneak

I mean play hide and seek

Know that I'm gonna find you

Make sure you get left or you leave



I saw you

And knew what I was trying to do



I had to play it real, real smooth

And once I finally made my move



I went crazy over you

Over you, only you

I went crazy over you



Like E-E-E-E

E-E-E-E

E-E-E-E



Feels wrong, but it's right, right

Blacked out, no night light

Pinked out like Fight Night

Maxed out of my mind, and the price right

Might buy, might bite



Never the regular, degular

Would clean my mess up

But I rather mess it up

Simple is so-so, I need that, oh no

Don't you know? I'm loco



I saw you

And knew what I was trying to do



I had to play it real, real smooth

And once I finally made my move



I went crazy over you

Over you, only you

I went crazy over you



Like E-E-E-E

E-E-E-E

E-E-E-E



Boy, by the time I'm done

I won't be the only one

Acting like you made me

You can't blame me



Swear once you get a taste

You gon' take my place

And you'll love me crazy



Sound the alarms



I'ma be mad till you get me back in them arms



Charge



Give me all you got

Go insane with it, better love hard



Love me like crazy

I love you crazy
