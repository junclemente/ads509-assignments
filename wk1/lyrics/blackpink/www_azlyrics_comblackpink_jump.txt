"JUMP (ë°ì´)"

[Romanized:]



I'm not that easy to tame

You should see me under these lights, all my tears turn to ice

That's the sweetest escape

Every time the feeling kicks in, I might stay through the night



Bet you get it now

Rocked that, didn't I?

Chakgak hajima nuga nugunji Whoa

Guess we gunnin' back (You know I walk, yeah, I talk it)

That prima donna spice up your life

You know I got that shit that you like

So come up with me, run up, uh, jump

Ttwieo



Watch me runnin' up the place

I'm already stuntin' and my girls are on the way

Ttwieo

Watch me open up the place

Wanna see you bumpin', baby, bouncin' to the bass



Are you not entertained?

I ain't gotta explain

I'm with all of my sisters

Got 'em goin' insane, yeah

You know we on a mission

All gas, no brakes, yeah

Breakin' out of the system

Breakin' out of this cage, yeah



Bet you get it now
