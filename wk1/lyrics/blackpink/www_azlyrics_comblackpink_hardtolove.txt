"Hard To Love"

Ain't no magic tool to fix it

You should keep your distance

I'm only tellin' you because I care



'Cause I'm hard to love, find it hard to trust

When it feels too good, I just fuck it up

You want all of me, I can't give that much

So don't fall too hard 'cause I'm hard to love



(Yeah)

I'm hard to love

Yeah

(Hard to love)



Never meant to cause you a problem

Here I am yet once again with the same old story

You don't see the issues, I got 'em

Yeah, I do (Yeah, I do), yeah, it's true (Yeah, it's true)

I'll make it feel like heaven, but I swear I'm not a saint

And you won't see the truth 'cause I'll be kissin' it away

Yeah, I'll be all you need until I'm drivin' you insane

Baby, all I'm tryna do is save you the pain



'Cause I'm hard to love, find it hard to trust

When it feels too good, I just fuck it up

You want all of me, I can't give that much

So don't fall too hard 'cause I'm hard to love



(Yeah)

I'm hard to love

Yeah

(Hard to love)



Up 'til I'm down

I'm all in 'til I'm out

Got a lot to work out

'Til it's all behind me

You know you don't

Play with fire in the dark

Protect your heart

Ain't no goin' back once you start

I'm tryna be nice



(Yeah)

I'm hard to love

Yeah

(Hard to love)
