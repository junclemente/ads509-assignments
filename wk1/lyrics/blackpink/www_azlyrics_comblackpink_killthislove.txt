[English translation:]



Yeah, yeah, yeah

BLACKPINK IN YOUR AREA!

Yeah, yeah, yeah



After a sweet "hi", there's always a bitter "bye"

After every crazy high, there's a price you have to pay

There's no answer to this test I'll always fall for it yes

I'm a slave to my emotions

Screw this heartless love



Here I come kick in the door

Give me the strongest one

So obvious, that love

Give me more, give me some more

Cling onto the edge of the cliff if you want

With just one word you're like starstruck again

That warm nervous feeling, extreme excitement

Felt like heaven but you might not get in it



Look at me, look at you, who will be in more pain?

You smart like who? You are

If you cry tears of blood from both eyes

So sorry like who? You are

What should I do, I can't stand myself being so weak

While I force myself to cover my eyes

I need to bring an end to this love



Let's kill this love!

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Rum, pum, pum, pum, pum, pum, pum

Let's kill this love!

Rum, pum, pum, pum, pum, pum, pum



Feelin' like a sinner

It's so fire with him I go boo hoo

He said you look crazy

Thank you baby

I owe it all to you

Got me all messed up

His love is my favorite

But you plus me

Sadly can be dangerous



Lucky me, lucky you

After all, in the end we lie

So what? So what?

If I end up forgetting you

So sorry

I'm not sorry

What should I do? I can't stand myself being so weak

While I force myself to hide my tears

I need to bring an end to this love



Let's kill this love!

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Rum, pum, pum, pum, pum, pum, pum

Let's kill this love!

Rum, pum, pum, pum, pum, pum, pum



We all commit to love
