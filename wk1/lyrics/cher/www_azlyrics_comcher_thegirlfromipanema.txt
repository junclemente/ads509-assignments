"The Girl From Ipanema"

Tall and tan and young and lovely

The girl from Ipanema goes walking

And when she passes

Each one she passes goes a-a-h!

When she walks she's like a samba

That' way so sweat and swings so gently

That when she passes

Each one she passes goes a-a-h!



Ooh but he watches her so sadly

How can he tell her he loves her

Yes he would give his heart gladly

But each day when she walks to the sea

She looks straight ahead not at him



Tall and tan and young and lovely

The girl from Ipanema goes walking

And when she passes he smiles but she doesn't see



Ooh but he watches her so sadly

How can he tell her he loves her

Yes he would give his heart gladly

But each day when she walks to the sea

She looks straight ahead not at him



Tall and tan and young and lonely

The girl from Ipanema goes walking

And when she passes

He smiles but she doesn't see

She just doesn't see

She just doesn't see

She just doesn't see
